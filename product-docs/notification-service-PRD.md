# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project:** Centralized Notification Service
**Owner:** \[Your Name / Product Manager]
**Date:** \[YYYY-MM-DD]
**Version:** 1.0

---

## **1. Introduction**

The Notification Service is a centralized platform that enables all internal microservices to send notifications to customers via multiple channels, including **email, in-app UI, mobile push notifications, and SMS**.
It will handle **high throughput** and provide **reliable, scalable, and consistent message delivery** across channels.

This service will be **built in Go** for performance and will expose APIs and SDKs for easy integration by other teams.

---

## **2. Objectives**

- Provide a **single, reliable API** for sending notifications across multiple channels.
- Reduce duplication of notification logic across microservices.
- Ensure **high throughput** and **low latency** under heavy load from 20+ microservices.
- Support **future extensibility** for adding new channels (e.g., WhatsApp, voice calls).
- Offer **delivery tracking** and **analytics** for sent notifications.

---

## **3. Scope**

**In Scope:**

- API for sending notifications.
- Support for Email, Push Notifications, SMS, and In-App messages.
- Notification routing logic to send via correct channels.
- Integration with external providers (SMTP servers, push notification services, SMS gateways).
- Message templates with variable substitution.
- Retry mechanism for failed deliveries.
- Logging and auditing.
- Delivery status tracking.

**Out of Scope (for v1):**

- End-user preference management (may be added in v2).
- Complex campaign management (bulk marketing).
- AI-based personalization.

---

## **4. Target Users / Stakeholders**

- **Internal microservice teams** (20+ existing services).
- **Customer-facing apps** (web and mobile).
- **Operations team** for monitoring.
- **Developers** integrating with Notification Service APIs.

---

## **5. Functional Requirements**

1. **API Interface**

   - REST API endpoints for sending notifications.
   - Support for synchronous acknowledgment and asynchronous processing.
   - Authentication and authorization for internal services.

2. **Supported Channels**

   - **Email** (via SMTP or third-party API like SendGrid, SES)
   - **SMS** (via Twilio, Nexmo, or equivalent)
   - **Push notifications** (via FCM/APNs)
   - **In-app notifications** (via WebSocket or message polling)

3. **Message Templates**

   - Create, store, and manage templates.
   - Support placeholders for personalization.

4. **Routing and Load Handling**

   - Intelligent routing based on channel availability.
   - Rate limiting per service to prevent overload.

5. **Retries and Failover**

   - Automatic retries on failures with exponential backoff.
   - Failover to backup providers.

6. **Delivery Tracking**

   - Status tracking (sent, delivered, failed).
   - Query API for delivery reports.

7. **Observability**

   - Structured logging (JSON format).
   - Metrics for throughput, latency, error rate.
   - Integration with Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.

---

## **6. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:** Handle 10,000+ requests per second with p95 latency under 100ms.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling with load balancers.
- **Reliability:** 99.99% uptime SLA.
- **Security:** API authentication via service-to-service credentials.
- **Compliance:** GDPR-compliant for customer data.
- **Extensibility:** New channels should be pluggable without service downtime.

---

## **7. Assumptions & Dependencies**

- All internal microservices can integrate via REST or gRPC.
- External providers (e.g., SMTP server, SMS gateway) have sufficient capacity.
- A message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) will be available for async processing.
- Network latency between services is low (same data center or region).

---

## **8. Acceptance Criteria**

- Able to send notifications to all supported channels.
- 99% of messages delivered within SLA.
- Full end-to-end delivery tracking is functional.
- No more than 0.1% failed deliveries without retry.
- Successfully handles load tests simulating traffic from all 20 microservices.

## **10. Open Questions**

- Which external providers will we choose for SMS and Email?
- Should delivery tracking be real-time or batched?
- Do we need message queue persistence for 30 days or less?
